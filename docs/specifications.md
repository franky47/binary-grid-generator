# Binary Grid Generator

This app generates a series of images representing a binary grid with a random
distribution of ones and zeroes.

It has been written to help my wife [https://twitter.com/pennyrose89](@pennyrose89)
with her experiment during her thesis.

The app has several parameters:
* The size of the grid, a square of side N
* The number of different grids to generate
* The probability distribution of ones

## Project Management

### Sprint 1 - MVP

For the first sprint, I'll focus on getting the base functionality of the backend
up and running.

The backend will be implemented as a serverless function, on [https://webtask.io](webtask.io),
in Node.js.
